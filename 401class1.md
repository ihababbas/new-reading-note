###  A friendly intro to Big O Notation

O(1)
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

O(N²)
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

O(2^N)
O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. 


### Names and Values in Python

#### Rules for Python variables:

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
