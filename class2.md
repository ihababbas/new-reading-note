## Reading

### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

  render

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

Mounting

### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

1. constructor
2. React Updates
3. render
4. componentDidMount
5. componentWillUnmount

### What does componentDidMount do?

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
