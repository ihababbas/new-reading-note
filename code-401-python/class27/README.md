## Graphs

* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

* Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Directed vs Undirected

#### Undirected Graphs
* An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

* For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional

* The undirected graph we are looking at has 6 vertices and 7 undirected edges.

* Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

* Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}

#### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
* A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

* Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

* Compare the visual below with the undirected graph above. Can you see the difference? The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.

* The directed graph above has six vertices and eight directed edges

* Vertices = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

* Edges = {(a,c),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,a),(d,e)(e,c)(e,f)}
