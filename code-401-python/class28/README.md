## Authentication & Production Server

### JSON Web Tokens

* A JSON Web Token(JWT) is a standard that defines a compact, self-contained way to transmit info as a JSON object. It can be verified and trusted as it is digitally signed and can signed with a secret or public/private key.
* A signed token verifies the integrity of the claim, while a encrypted token hides the claims from other parties.
* They are most often used for Authorization and Information Exchange.

* It is structured into a Header, Payload, and Signature and are separated by dots.
  - The Header is the type of token and the algorithm used
  - The Payload is the claims which are the statements about the entity and other data. They are further seperated into Registered, Public, and Private.
  - The signature is created by taking the encrypted header, payload, a secret, and the specified algorithm and signing it.

* The output is three base64 strings that are seperated by dots and easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments.

* In authentication, when the user sucessfully logs in a JWT is created and these tokens shouldn't be kept any longer than required for security reasons


* When the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the JWT would be sent with the request to sometimes be used by the route/resource to verify it's valid

* The benefits of a JWT over other solutions like a SWT or SAML arel
  - Less verbose and therfore smaller and easier to pass in an HTTP and HTML environment.
  - It can use a public/private key pair.
  - JSON parsers are common in programming languages.


### DRF JWT Authentication

* When using a JWT, on the app side, it has a Access Token and a Refresh Token which are used for security purposes.
* For a Django Rest Framework, the recommended library is the SimpleJWT library for djangorestframework
* To authenticate and recieve the token, you use the /api/token route which only takes POST requests.
  - The response body will have the access token and refresh token.
  - The access token typically lasts 5 minutes before needing to be refreshed with /api/token/refresh/ and posting the refresh token
  - The refresh token typically lasts 24 hours before the user needs to do a full login again.
* The reasons for having both tokens is for security and permissions reasons.


### Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server

* Using Runserver is not to be used once the app reaches Production. Any server started with runserver isn't guaranteed to be performant and hasn't been built with security concerns in mind.
* When the tech reaches production; it should be reliable, well-tested, and been around for a while. It is usually consisting of multiple components, each designed to be good at one thing.
* When a request arrives at the server it should be passed and handled by a dedicated web server like Nginx.
* As an application, it is good at serving static files from the disk like CSS and JS files and handling multiple requests at a time,but if the request isn't for a static file, the webserver will pass it to the next component;
* The application server, which gets the requests and constructs python objects usable by Django. WSGI and Gunicorn are good examples.
* The Django app doesn't actually run like you typically think a server does where it waits for requests and reacts to them. It has a uwsgi.py that has a function to be called by the application server and gets a python object representing the request.
  - The function then calls the code and produces a response object passed to the WSGI server and is translated to a HTTP response and passed to the web server, then delivered to the user.

* In conclusion, when in production, use a web server like Nginx and Gunicorn for WSGI.
  - Or Heroku where you just specify Gunicorn in the Procfile.
