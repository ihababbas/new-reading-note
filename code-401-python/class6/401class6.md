### Software Design Patterns Simplified

A design pattern is only a description or template for how to solve a problem! that can be used in many different situations. So every design pattern provide a solution to commonly occurring software design problems. Patterns are formalized best practices that the Software Developer can use to solve common problems when designing an application.

Below is thew difference between, Programming Paradigms, Architectural Patterns, Design Patterns and Design Principles:

1. Programming Paradigms
2. Architectural Patterns
3. Design Patterns
4. Design Principles

There is 3 major types of design patterns:
Creational Patterns:
Creational patterns provide ways to instantiate single or groups of objects. Making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the situation.
Structural Patterns:
Structural patterns provide a manner to define relationships between classes or objects. Making it easier for these entities to work together.
Behavioral Patterns:
Behavioral patterns define manners of communication between classes and objects. Making it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.


### Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is the process of identifying and analyzing potential issues that could negatively impact key business initiatives or projects. This process is done in order to help organizations avoid or mitigate those risks.

Risk Analysis allows you to examine the risks that you or your organization face, and helps you decide whether or not to move forward with a decision.

Risk Identification :

There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

Business Risks : any exposure a company or organization has to factor(s) that may lower its profits or cause it to go bankrupt.

Testing Risks

Premature Release Risk : a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

Software Risks : probability of occurrence for uncertain events and their potential for loss within an organization.

Risk Assessment : is the process of identifying what hazards currently exist or may appear in the workplace.

The perspective of Risk Assessment

Effect : To evaluate risk based on the effect. If you identify a condition, event, or action and try to assess its significance.

Cause : Assessing risk by Cause is the inverse of assessing risk by Effect. Begin scanning the problem and working your way to the point where you believe the most likely cause is.

Likelihood : To assess risk using Likelihood means to say that there is a chance that a requirement will not be met.

How to Conduct a Risk Analysis

There are three steps to take:

Looking for the danger

Examining the consequences of each individual risk

Risk mitigation strategies
