## Django CRUD and Forms
### Django Forms
* You an use HTML forms with Django to make CRUD requests and they are a relatively secure way to share data with a server.
* Just like other tasks with Django, using a form follows some of the same techniques where the view gets a request, performs the necessary actions then returns an HTML page in a template.
* Django's form handling does a number of things, such as;
     Display a default form when requested by a user the first time
     Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form
     Clean and validate the data
     If any data is invalid, re-display the form with error messages and user-populated info
     If data is valid, perform required actions
     Then, when all actions are done, redirect to another page.
* The most fundamental tool with Django for this task is the Form class.
     It specifies the fields in the form and other key attributes and rules about the data they accept
     When declaring a Form, it follows a similar syntax to that of a Model.
     The data is stored in the forms.py file.
     One way to validate data is to override the clean_<fieldname>() method for the field you want to check.
* However, while the above information is useful for creating a new form, if all you need is a form to map the fields for a single Model, then most of the work is already done for you and you could far more easily use the ModelForm helper class.
