## Hashtabels

### Intro to Hash Tables, What is a Hash Table, Basics of Hash Tables


* A hashtable is a data structure that uses key value pairs.
* The idea is that the hashtable stores the key and can quickly and efficiently retrieve it
  - This is done through a hash which is the ability to encode the key that maps to a location in the data structure that can be looked at to find the value
* Some common terminology for a hashtable are
 - Hash, the result of an algorithm taking a string and converting it to a value.
 - Bucket, is what is contained at each index of the list of the hashtable and each index is a bucket an in the case of a collision can contain multiple key/value pairs
 - Collisions, which are what happens when multiple keys get hashed to the same location.
* Because the key is hashed, the lookup for the location later is an O(1) operation.
* A hash code turns a key into an integer and need to be deterministic, where the output is determined only by the input.
* To hash a key, you start with the size of a list and then do some operation to it. The following is only one example;
 1. Add/multiply the ASCII values of the key together
 2. Multiply by a prime number
 3. Modulo to get the remainder when divided by the size of the list
 4. Insert at that index
* A common way to deal with potential collisions is to make each bucket a linked list.
* A hashmap often has four base internal methods:
 
    * Add, that hashs the key and inserts at the returned index number, as part of the linked list in the bucket if there is already a value there
    * Find, which takes in a key and returns the correct value at that position of the hashtable for that key.
    * Contains, which accepts a key and returns a boolean if that key exists within the hashtable.
    * GetHash, which is the hashing function that determines the index positions.
