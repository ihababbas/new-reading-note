## Django REST Framework & Docker

### Beginner’s Guide to Docker

* Docker is a way to isolate and run applications regardless of operation system, language, packages or databases.
* The downside to using it is the complexity it can operate at, but a little knowledge goes a long way.
* Docker is essentially a bunch of Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.
* Virtualization and more specifically virtual machines was an early solution to the problem of needing multiple programmers on a single machine.
* A good analogy is that of a house and an apartment:
 - A virtual machine is a house, stand-alone, with their own infrastructure
 - Docker is like an apartment, it shares common infrastructure but is sized to meet the needs of the owner.
* The way we have been doing it, through virtual environments are good, but they can only be used for python packages and can't run a production database or other services.

* When starting off, understanding Images and Containers are important concepts to grasp;
 - An image is a snapshot of the code at a specific time
 - A container is the final code.
* The __Dockerfile__ is the list of instructions to create the image
* Images can be layered
* Containers are the running instance of an image
* __docker-compose.yml__ controls how the container runs

### Django for APIs - Library Website

* The Django REST framework works alongside the Django web framework to build web APIs.
* The most important takeaway from the article is that Django creates webpages, while Django REST creates web APIs.
* Once the REST API is installed, you need to include it in Django's settings.py under Installed Apps
* Under the Django REST framework, the output when going to a url is serialized json data
* The REST framework relies on a model, a url and a serializer file.
* A serializer translates complex data like a queryset or model instance into a format like JSON.
