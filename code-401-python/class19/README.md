## Intro to Django

### Getting started with Django
* Django's data models can be defined within Python and you can use the ORM for a database-access API within Django

* Having a clean URL scheme is a important ingredient in high-quality web-applications.

* Django's template language is designed to be a balance between power and ease.

* Django also has a powerful library for forms that handles the rendering, the validating and the converting to Python data types
  It also has a way to generate and use forms based on Models for CRUD operations.
* Django also has a fully featured authentication system.

* One of Django's most powerful tools is the admin interface that reads metadata in the Models and provides a production ready interface for content producers to manage data.

* Django also has multiple protections against;
  1. Clickjacking
  2. Cross-site scripting
  3. CSRF
  4. SQL injection
  5. Remote code execution


### How Django Works Behind the Scenes

* Django is an open source Python web framework developed by three people at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper.
* It has major releases every 9 months, security releases nearly monthly and has an issue tracker.
* For funding it took the path of a non-profit in 2008 with the Django Software Foundation(DSF)
* Of all the funding it takes in, the largest expense is the Fellows program that are paid contractors that triage tickets, manage releases and perform the dirty work to make Django stay on track.
* The DSF also handles all the legal, financial, and administrative matter needed for Django.
