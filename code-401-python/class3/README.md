###  A friendly intro to Big O Notation
#### What is it ?
simplified analysis of an algorithm's efficiency
1. complex in terms of on input size N
2. machine indepadent
3. basic computer steps
4. time and space

O(1)
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

O(N²)
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

O(2^N)
O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
