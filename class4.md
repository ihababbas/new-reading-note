## React Docs - Forms

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
     An input form element whose value is controlled by React renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

     no we should not , With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
    becuse we know what the input kind is

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

### Why would we use a ternary operator?
    This shorter code yields us the same result
### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

 console.log((x===y) ? 'true' : 'false';)
